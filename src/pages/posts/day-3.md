# Day 3
It's friday, and I need to come back down a little bit and handle some non coding related work. I still plan on getting as much coding done as I can today but today is the first day this week that it cannot be a priority sadly. I plan on going pretty hard this weekend though, so I am telling myself I just need to get through today and then I will be able to get more done this weekend than I did all week. 

This is a good time to talk about my weekly schedule. I follow this schedule everyday Sunday-Friday:

3am-6am: Coffe, morning journal, focus Work in my office (3 hours)
6am-7am: Project management , Admin Work, Email (1 hour)
7am-9am: Quality family time with the kids, breakfast and clean up at 8am (2 hours)
9am-11am: Focus Work in my office (2 hours)
11:00am-12pm: back upstairs for lunch with the family (1 hour)
12pm-3pm: This is my flex work block that I reserve for meetings, anything open is used for work that doesnt require deep focus work. (3 hours)
3pm-4pm: This is where I plan for the follow day, address any outstanding slack messages or emergencies, and shut down for the day. I would like to start getting a 30 minute workout in during this time period soon. (1 hour)

By 4pm most days I have put a solid 10 hours in. at least 4 of which is devoted to deep focused work. 2 hours has been proven to be the ideal amount of time the human brain can focus, I give myself 2 of these per day, sometimes I get a third if the meetings are light. It took me about 3 years of experimentation and trying different schedules to find out what works for me. This schedule is heavily adapted to my wife and kids, which is the main reason I get up at 3am. I also naturally wake up at that time, and always have. It took me many years to embrace that.

From 4pm-7pm we do family stuff, dinner, housework, bathtime and playing with the kids. from 7-8 I get some time dedicated to reading or just zoning out. Intential rest. And then somewhere between 8-10pm I head to bed.

Some other helpful tips, is that I uninstalled reddit from my phone, my social media addiction of choice, and instead I open up kindle and read pages here and there when I would have normally been scrolling. My main hobby of choice is scale modeling and miniature painting, so I also set up little paint stations in my office, and upstairs so I make sure that I do at least 15 minutes of that everyday, usually during unimportant meetings. I also make sure that I write 1000 words everyday. This is part of that total, but I also do a daily journal during family time, and sometimes I make intentential content to post on various blogs and sites.

### Resources used


### Courses Complete So Far
#### Fireship's Full Course on Git
Link: https://fireship.io/courses/git/ 

I give this course a full 5/5. This was fast and straight to the point with no BS, I hope that all of their courses are like this.

Biggest takeaway: How git actually works, not just typing the commands into terminal and knowing what it does, but why thats what we do. It was good to get a refreshing on best practices for pull requests and using version control with teammates.

I finally KNOW what CI/CD entails, instead of just, "like yeah I know what ci/cd is..."

#### Fireships VS Code Magic Tricks Course
Linked: https://fireship.io/courses/vscode-tricks/

Same as above, 5/5, straight to the point and covers everything I wanted to know succintly. 

Biggest takeaway: How to setup VS Code for ease of use and productivity, beyond just using it out of the box.
