Today I am starting off by following this guide: https://www.swyx.io/download-twitter-spaces to set up the ability to download twitter spaces from JavaScript Jam. This took me about 2 minutes to set up, and most of it was waiting for go to install. I set this up in a virtual machine to make sure there was nothing crazy going on in the binary. Normally, I would not have even attempted this and just skipped over it for another solution, but this was crazy easy to get up and running and now I am already running the file through descript.

I put about 2 hours into the original jam-markdown repo and kept running into problems stemming not being the one that built it out. I obivously need to be at the point one day where I can look someone elses code and make it work, but today is not that day. So I started fresh using the awesome tutorial in the Astro docs to create a new project using that. I stripped out the css and my plan is to install tailwind and start using that. The original repo I was using had tailwind, but I want to learn how to set it up and start using it myself. So now the goal is to rebuild that other repo myself.

### Priorities for today
- [ ] Basic homepage layout with tailwind
- [ ] Blog layout with tailwind
- [x] Reading times on posts
- [x] Connected to vercel to deploy on mattglbrt.com
### Maybe today, probably tomorrow
- [ ] Navigation menu might push this to tomorrow but we will see
- [ ] Redix Ui installed

### Resources used
* https://fireship.io/ Last night I started going through fireship.io course, specifically the git and vs code courses as refreshers. Ive used both for years, but wanted to make sure I had full comprehension of the tools
* https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/ I followed this tutorial inside of the repo that Daniel set up for me. This way I was using our defined stack but also had the tutorial blog ready to build upon. I didn't want to totally reinvent the wheel.

### Courses Complete
#### Fireship's Full Course on Git
Link: https://fireship.io/courses/git/ 

I give this course a full 5/5. This was fast and straight to the point with no BS, I hope that all of their courses are like this.

Biggest takeaway: How git actually works, not just typing the commands into terminal and knowing what it does, but why thats what we do. It was good to get a refreshing on best practices for pull requests and using version control with teammates.

I finally KNOW what CI/CD entails, instead of just, "like yeah I know what ci/cd is..."

#### Fireships VS Code Magic Tricks Course
Linked: https://fireship.io/courses/vscode-tricks/

Same as above, 5/5, straight to the point and covers everything I wanted to know succintly. 

Biggest takeaway: How to setup VS Code for ease of use and productivity, beyond just using it out of the box.
