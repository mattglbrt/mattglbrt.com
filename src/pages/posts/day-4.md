# Day 4
Saturdays are family days around here so I did not have much time to code, but I was able to start working on a simple landing page with a contact form to replace a basic wordpress site for one of my clients thats always hacked. I started working from another persons repo, but then thought about i and would rather make something from scratch so that I can make it available for other people to use. So I push code today, but I dont htink that I will be using it. Tomorrow I am hoping to finish it and make something that I can push up and share for other people to actually use. This is a pretty basic form on side and picture on the other with no content, so I am not sure how useful it will be to other people. This site is for a person that needed to have something up but did not want to invest any time, money or effort into it. I think they really just need a website as a formality for government contract actually. So tomorrow that will be my new priority. No resources or relevant guides today, but I have more planned for tomorrow.
