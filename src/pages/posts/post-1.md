Today is really about just knocking the rust off and geting back into coding with a coordinated effort and real concrete goals. I want to start fresh so I factory reset my macbook and had to set up a dev environment. I went through the usual steps of installing VScode, Home Brew, Xcode tools, git, and some recommended VS Code extensions from @danielsnell.

He also set me up with a repo for starting a few of our internal projects that I am going to use as a base to build out some of the coming projects. My focus for today is learning Astro, which I have already gone through every step of their great tutorial in teh their official docs and finished that, but now I am going in a little deeper on the markdown.

Today I followed the full astro tutorial and then went into the two docs pages about markdown specifically and creating collections. 

At the end of coding today I have a functioning but ugly as hell blog with:
* Astro
* Tailwind
* Typescript
* Radix-UI
* Svelte

Calling this first day a massive success. I also started looking at next and sanity starters in the evening but we just kidn of playing around.

## Goals for today:

- [x] Set up mac dev environment
- [x]  Learn how to pull dynamic files into a template
- [x] Set Up Jam-markdown repo from Daniel
- [x] Set up repo for personal blog

## Plan for tomorrow
- [ ] Build  homepage in tailwind
- [ ] Built  blog page template
- [ ] Build About Page
